Topic:Smart Water Level Controller for Thermal Industry Tank(Mini Project)

HydroEye is an automated water level monitoring and pump control system designed for thermal industry storage tanks.

It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure water level and displays the percentage on an LCD. The system automatically controls the pump to prevent water shortage and overflow.

⚙️ Features

Real-time water level monitoring

LCD percentage display

AUTO & MANUAL operating modes

Automatic pump control

Calibration button for max level setting

EEPROM memory storage (retains data after power off)

🔄 Working Logic

Water level < 30% → Pump ON

Water level = 100% → Pump OFF

AUTO mode → Fully automatic operation

MANUAL mode → Operator controls pump

🏭 Benefits

Prevents water shortage

Avoids overflow

Protects pump from dry running

Reduces manual monitoring

Saves energy and cost

Project: Water Level Controller for Thermal Industry Tank(MINI PROJECT)

This project is used to check and control the water level in a thermal industry storage tank. An ultrasonic sensor measures the water level and shows the percentage on an LCD display.

If the tank water level goes below 30%, the pump turns ON automatically.

When the tank is full (100%), the pump turns OFF.

The system can work in AUTO mode (automatic pump control) or MANUAL mode (operator can switch pump ON/OFF).

A calibration button is provided to set the maximum tank level, and the value is stored in memory (EEPROM), so it works even after power off.


This system helps the thermal industry by:

Avoiding water shortage for heating/cooling.

Preventing overflow and pump damage.

Reducing manual checking and saving energy.
