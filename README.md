Project: Water Level Controller for Thermal Industry Tank(MINI PROJECT)

This project is used to check and control the water level in a thermal industry storage tank. An ultrasonic sensor measures the water level and shows the percentage on an LCD display.

If the tank water level goes below 30%, the pump turns ON automatically.

When the tank is full (100%), the pump turns OFF.

The system can work in AUTO mode (automatic pump control) or MANUAL mode (operator can switch pump ON/OFF).

A calibration button is provided to set the maximum tank level, and the value is stored in memory (EEPROM), so it works even after power off.


This system helps the thermal industry by:

Avoiding water shortage for heating/cooling.

Preventing overflow and pump damage.

Reducing manual checking and saving energy.
